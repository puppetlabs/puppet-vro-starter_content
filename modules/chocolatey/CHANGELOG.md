# Approved Community Module Changelog - Chocolatey Team

The Chocolatey team has graciously agreed to allow Puppet to take this module
to the next level. Puppet will rerelease a supported module under the original
versioning scheme. For now we are using a number less than 1.0 to show that this
could have some technical issues and should be treated as a prerelease version.
