##Overview
This is a module that will manage the Microsoft Windows Firewall and it's exceptions.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_firewall.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_firewall)

##Module Description

The windows_firewall module will primarily manage the state of the windows firewall application on your windows system. Optionally it will also
allow you to configure any exceptions that you need to have in place.

##Setup

###What windows_firewall affects:

* windows firewall service and corrisponding Windows Registry keys
* windows registry keys and values for any defined exception rules

###Beginning with windows_firewall

The windows_firewall resource allows you to manage the firewall service itself.

	class { 'windows_firewall': ensure => 'stopped' }

Once the windows firewall is managed you may then want to start managing the rules and exceptions within it.

    windows_firewall::exception { 'WINRM':
      ensure       => present,
      direction    => 'in',
      action       => 'Allow',
      enabled      => 'yes',
      protocol     => 'TCP',
      local_port   => '5985',
      remote_port  => 'any',
      display_name => 'Windows Remote Management HTTP-In',
      description  => 'Inbound rule for Windows Remote Management via WS-Management. [TCP 5985]',
    }
