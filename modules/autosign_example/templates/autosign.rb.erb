# A note on logging:
#   This script's stderr and stdout are only shown at the DEBUG level
#   of the master's logs. This means you won't see the error messages
#   in puppetserver.log by default. All you'll see is the exit code.
#
#   https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/ssl_autosign.html#policy-executable-api
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0 - A matching challengePassword was found.
#   1 - No challengePassword was found.
#   2 - The wrong challengePassword was found.
